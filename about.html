            <h2>History and Beginnings</h2>
            <p>The Church of the Great Redeemer began in June of 2024 when a group of committed Christians made the decision of conscience and faith to leave the United Methodist Church following the disastrous 2024 UMC General Conference. Those who now comprise CGR (Church of the Great Redeemer) were seeking to worship God in spirit and truth (John 4:24) abide in and by His Word, and grow in love and holiness, all while the United Methodist denomination was and is going in a very different direction and marching to a very different beat of the drum. What results is the CGR, who could no longer in good conscience support, contribute, or be a part of the UMC. We are a faithful remnant, preserved by God, for God, to be a church, a community, and a people who love the Lord and boldly and unapologetically proclaim His Word and truth. We have resolved to make the Word of God-and not a changing culture- our standard of living.</p>

            <p>We believe the current era calls for us, and for all churches, to cling ever more to the truth of scriptures, and be willing to make the sacrifices that accompany that stance, to be unmoved by the calling and beckoning of the world, nor swayed by their discontentment or hatred. We believe it is the duty of the church to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ by standing firmly on the Word, and living out our faith in love, unity, and service.</p>

            <p>CGR is not just a people, but a story, one that God continues to write and bless by His providence. We are a church and people of humble beginnings with great expectations because we believe and trust that God rewards and blesses faithfulness. We are a people dedicated to the God, to His Word, and to each other.</p>

            <h2>Worship</h2>
            <p>Our worship service is traditional with the usage of hymns and powerful liturgies that engage the heart, soul, and mind, and connect us with the saints of old through tradition and heritage. The primary component is the preaching of the Word led by Pastor Dan. We believe that worship is to not for our entertainment but our edification, not for our amusement but to increase in knowledge and love of God. We believe worship is to be done in reverence to the glory of God, and we strive to do so every Sunday when we gather together.</p>

            <h2>The Pastor</h2>
            <p>Our pastor at CGR is Dan Meader. In 2017 he began his pastoral ministry as a licensed local pastor in the United Methodist denomination. He was appointed to Weatherly in 2019 and in 2024 helped to lead a group of people away from the UMC to form a new church, Church of the Great Redeemer. His passion is the preaching and teaching of God`s Word.</p>
